# =============================================================================
# Factory Reference Structure Definition
# =============================================================================
# Defines the structure for referencing factories within blueprints.
# Factory references allow inline factory usage with custom attributes
# and build strategies.
#
# Example usage in blueprints:
#   factories.user:
#     attributes:
#       role: "admin"
#     strategy: build
# =============================================================================

attributes:
  type: hash
  default: {}
  description: |-
    Attribute overrides for this specific factory invocation.
    Merged with the factory's default attributes. Supports variable
    interpolation and faker data generation.
  examples:
    - name: "Custom Name"
      email: "custom@test.com"
    - role: "{{ user_role }}"
      active: true

build_strategy:
  type: string
  default: create
  aliases:
    - strategy
  description: |-
    The FactoryBot build strategy to use. Determines whether records
    are persisted to the database or just built in memory.
    - create: Persists to database (default) - use for integration tests
    - build: Builds without saving - use when testing logic, not persistence
    - build_stubbed: Builds with stubbed ID - fastest, use for unit tests
      that don't need DB interaction
  examples:
    - "create"
    - "build"
    - "build_stubbed"

size:
  type: integer
  default: 0
  aliases:
    - count
  transformer: abs
  description: |-
    Number of records to create. When 0 (default), creates a single
    record. When > 0, creates that many records and returns an array.
    Useful for testing list endpoints or batch operations.
  examples:
    - 0
    - 5
    - 100
